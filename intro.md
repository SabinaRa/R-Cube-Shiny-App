__Introduction__

The purpose of this  application is to demonstrate a light-weight approach to multi-dimensional data exploration and data visualization using R Shiny.The **R Cube Data Explorer** tool can be used by a data analyst or a business manager to aggregate and visualize data in real-time.

This application let's you analyze a Retail Store data cube across 4 hierarchical dimensions [Store,Product,Time and Geography] and computes aggregated values for 3 measures [Unit Sales, Total Revenue ($) and Gross Profit] using an Online Analytical Analytical Processing ( __OLAP__ ) approach. The retail cube is built on top of a synthetic data mart with 100,000 records.
